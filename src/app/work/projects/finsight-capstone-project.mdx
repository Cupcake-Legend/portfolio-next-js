## Overview
FinSight is an AI-powered financial advisor designed to democratize investment strategies. As part of the **Bangkit 2024 Batch 2** capstone, our team developed an end-to-end solution that takes complex market data, processes it via Machine Learning, and delivers actionable insights through a seamless mobile experience. The project is built on 3 key infrastructure:

1.  **Mobile Development**: A user-centric interface for real time portfolio tracking.
2.  **Machine Learning**: Advanced predictive models designed for stock price forecasting and sentiment analysis.
3.  **Cloud Computing**: The backbone that orchestrates data flow, authentication, and model deployment.

## Cloud Architecture & Infrastructure

The focus of a **Cloud Engineer** was building a scalable, secure, and automated environment using **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** and **Firebase**.

### System Design

### System Design & Automation

The architecture follows a microservices approach, with a heavy emphasis on automated data ingestion and real time user engagement:

- **Automated News Pipeline**: To keep investment advice fresh, a daily crawling service was implemented. **Cloud Scheduler** triggers a news scraping model running on **Compute Engine** every 24 hours. This ensures the ML models are always analyzing the latest market sentiment.
- **Asynchronous Messaging**: Utilized **Google Cloud Pub/Sub** to decouple notification service from the main API. This handles push notifications for stock alerts and news updates reliably, ensuring the mobile client receives data without blocking the main request thread.
- **Compute & API Gateway**: The backend is containerized using **Docker** and deployed on **Google Cloud Run**, providing a serverless environment that scales to zero when not in use, optimizing costs.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployments using **Google Cloud Build**, triggered by GitHub commits to ensure rapid iteration between the ML and Backend teams.

### Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js / Express.js
- **Compute**: Google Cloud Run (API) & Compute Engine (News Scraper)
- **Containerization**: Docker & Google Artifact Registry
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore & Cloud Storage
- **Orchestration & Messaging**: Cloud Pub/Sub & Cloud Scheduler
- **CI/CD**: Cloud Build & GitHub Actions

## Key Cloud Challenges

### 1. Model to API Integration
To address model serving challenges, the system employs a flask based microservice for ML logic, communicating with a Node.js API through internal GCP networking. This separation isolates computationally intensive predictions from core user management functions.

### 2. Environment Management

Handling sensitive Firebase Service Account keys across development and production environments was solved by using **GCP Secret Manager**, ensuring no credentials were leaked in the repository.

## Outcome
The final cloud infrastructure achieved 99.9% availability during testing, with the API consistently responding to prediction requests in under 200ms. Offloading data-heavy ML tasks to specialized cloud instances ensured the mobile application remained lightweight and responsive.
