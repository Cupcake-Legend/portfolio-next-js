## Overview

This project involves the development of a decentralized land certificate management system to address the vulnerabilities of centralized registries, such as data manipulation and recording errors. The system leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency, immutability, and public verifiability of land ownership.The system utilizes a document hash mechanism to secure land certificate data without exposing sensitive information on-chain. By digitizing the traditional "Safe Deposit Box" concept, the architecture ensures transparency and immutability through a verification engine that cross-references blockchain hashes with cloud database records.

## Key Features

* **Consensus through Digital Signatures**: Implemented a validation logic where the agreement between all involved parties generates a verifiable digital signature. This process creates a collective consensus, ensuring that no single party can unilaterally alter a record.

* **Data Integrity**: Implemented a Document Hashing mechanism to store certificate metadata securely without exposing sensitive personal data on-chain.

* **Security**: Integrated the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to authenticate transactions and prevent unauthorized tampering.

* **Scalable Architecture**: Optimized the network to handle increasing peer counts. Testing proved that as the network expanded from 2 to 6 peers, transaction times actually improved by 0.62 seconds, resolving typical blockchain scalability bottlenecks.

* **Performance Optimization**: Conducted scalability testing across a peer network. Results demonstrated a non-linear performance improvement, with a 6-peer configuration processing transactions 0.62 seconds faster than a 2-peer setup.

* **Decentralized Verification**: Created a workflow that allows for independent verification of certificate authenticity, significantly reducing the risk of land disputes.

* **Immutable Audit Trail**: Utilized blockchain to store unique document hashes, providing a tamper-proof reference point for land records.

* **Multi-Layer Verification Logic**: Developed a verification engine that validates uploaded certificates by matching blockchain hashes against recalculated hashes from secure cloud databases, ensuring 100% data integrity.

## Technologies Used

* **Hyperledger Fabric**: The foundational blockchain framework used for developing and executing smart contracts (chaincode).
* **Google Cloud**: Provides the infrastructure for managing cryptographic identities, handling digital signing processes, and securing file storage.
* **Laravel**: Serves as the primary client-side access point, managing the user interface and initiating communication with the blockchain.
* **Express.js**: Acts as the critical middleware bridge, facilitating seamless data transfer between the Laravel client-side application and the blockchain network.
* **MySQL**: The relational database management system used to store and organize structured land certificate data alongside the ledger.

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge of this development was identifying a suitable consensus mechanism that accurately mirrors the existing land transaction system. Rather than focusing on standard network scalability, the research centered on a logic where the legal agreement of all involved parties is translated into digital signatures.

By verifying these signatures against each other, the system establishes a distributed consensus that maintains legal validity in a digital environment. This approach demonstrated that a signature-based agreement model can enhance network performance; testing revealed that increasing the network from 2 to 6 peers improved transaction speeds by 0.62 seconds, proving that decentralized verification can optimize throughput.
## Outcome
This project demonstrates the practical application of blockchain in digitizing complex legal trust structures. By transitioning from a centralized registry to a distributed signature-based consensus, the system minimizes the risk of land disputes and data forgery. The final implementation provides a transparent, verifiable audit trail that empowers the public to independently confirm the authenticity of land certificates.
